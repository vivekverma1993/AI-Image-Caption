# Project: Open-Source AI-Powered Image Captioning and Object Detection Application

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application that leverages open-source tools to perform image captioning and object detection. It utilizes tools like LangChain for building AI workflows, Hugging Face Transformers for model integration, and OpenCV for image processing. The goal is to create a flexible application that can analyze images and provide detailed descriptions and object tags.

## Features
- **Image Captioning**: Generate captions for images using pre-trained models.
- **Object Detection**: Identify and label objects within images.
- **Web Interface**: Upload images and view results via a user-friendly web interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the following packages:
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `flask`
- `opencv-python`
- `pillow`

Install them with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup
No specific API keys are needed as this project relies on open-source models.

### Running the Application
1. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd project-folder
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The app will run locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## API Endpoints

### 1. **Upload and Analyze Image**
**Endpoint**: `/analyze`  
**Method**: `POST`  
**Payload**: Image file (multipart/form-data)

### Example Workflow
1. **Upload an image via the web interface**.
2. The app processes the image and returns:
   - A generated caption describing the content of the image.
   - Labels and bounding boxes of detected objects.

## File Descriptions
- **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the Flask application.
- **`app/__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask app and registers routes.
- **`app/routes.py`**: Defines the routes and request handling logic.
- **`app/services/image_captioning.py`**: Contains logic for generating image captions using a pre-trained model.
- **`app/services/object_detection.py`**: Implements object detection using models like YOLO or Detectron2.
- **`app/services/utils.py`**: Utility functions for image processing and model loading.
- **`templates/index.html`**: A simple web page for image uploads.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists required Python packages.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more advanced image processing techniques.
- Add support for real-time video processing.
- Enhance the web interface with more interactivity.
